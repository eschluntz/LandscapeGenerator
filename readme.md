This program uses Perlin Noise to generate random landscapes and color them realistically. A number of parameters allow the user to tailor the scale and level of detail of the generated landscapes, and the program can produce surprisingly realistic results.

This was written in [Processing](http://www.processing.org) version 1.5, so it may take some effort to get it to run.
